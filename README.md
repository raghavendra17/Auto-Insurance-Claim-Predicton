# Auto-Insurance-Claim-Predictor
Python ML project using scikit learn,pandas,numpy,matplotlib

## Problem Statement:

To Predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year.

Most companies charge a flat premium to the customers irrespective of their risk for filing an insurance claim. Inaccuracies in car insurance companyâ€™s claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones. Our project will help the insurance company in following ways:

Affluent customer: Company can attract the good drivers if it is doing the fair pricing. Loss ratio: Company can avoid specific customer/policies if they are at high risk of filing claim which in turn decrease loss ratio. Fair pricing: Company can charge the premium to the customers by their risk, and accurate prediction will allow them to tailor their prices further. Claim forecast: Claim is proportional to the number of risky customers, so company forecast the number of claims it could get next year which will help them to manage their fund better

# Analysis Approach

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Contains the initial exploration of data like 
* Finding the distribution of target variables
* Handling missing values
* Inferences about continuous,ordinal,binary variables through Visualization
* Level of correlated variables
* Balancing the data using SMOTE 
* One-hot encoding/dummification of the categorical variables
* Feature scaling-Standardization for all ordinal and interval columns 

## Modeling
All Classification algorithms Like Logistic Regression,Support Vector Machines(Linear,Poly),KNN,Decision Trees,Random Forest,AdaBoost,XGBoost,GradientBoost
are used
Ensembling model like RandomForest and Bossting gave best results among all the algorithms
