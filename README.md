# Auto-Insurance-Claim-Predictor
Python ML project using scikit learn,pandas,numpy,matplotlib

## Problem Statement:

To Predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year.

Most companies charge a flat premium to the customers irrespective of their risk for filing an insurance claim. Inaccuracies in car insurance companyâ€™s claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones. Our project will help the insurance company in following ways:

Affluent customer: Company can attract the good drivers if it is doing the fair pricing. Loss ratio: Company can avoid specific customer/policies if they are at high risk of filing claim which in turn decrease loss ratio. Fair pricing: Company can charge the premium to the customers by their risk, and accurate prediction will allow them to tailor their prices further. Claim forecast: Claim is proportional to the number of risky customers, so company forecast the number of claims it could get next year which will help them to manage their fund better
